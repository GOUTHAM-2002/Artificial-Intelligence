Early Machine Translation Simulator (1950s-1960s)
----------------------------------------------
This program simulates the early attempts at machine translation during the 1950s and 1960s,
specifically demonstrating the Georgetown-IBM Experiment approach (1954).

Historical Context:
- One of the first demonstrations of machine translation was the Georgetown-IBM Experiment in 1954
- Used rule-based translation with a simple dictionary lookup system
- Translated 60 Russian sentences into English using just 6 grammar rules and 250 words

Limitations Demonstrated:
1. Word-by-word translation without understanding context
2. No grammar rules or sentence structure consideration
3. Unable to handle:
   - Verb conjugations
   - Word order differences between languages
   - Idioms and expressions
   - Word sense disambiguation (e.g., bank = financial institution vs. river bank)
   - Complex sentence structures

This simulation shows both the achievements and limitations of early MT systems,
highlighting why more sophisticated approaches were needed for effective translation.
